## Introduction
Retail businesses generate large volumes of data daily. This project focuses on analyzing retail data to understand sales performance, customer preferences, and product trends. By performing EDA, businesses can make data-driven decisions to optimize their strategies.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains retail transactions, including product details, sales, profits, and customer information. Example columns include:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product Name**: Name of the product sold.
- **Category**: Product category.
- **Sales**: Revenue generated.
- **Profit**: Profit earned.
- **Order Date**: Date of the order.

---

## Features of the Script
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and removes duplicates.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzes individual columns (e.g., distributions, value counts).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Explores relationships between variables using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
- **Visualization**: Uses 'matplotlib and 'seaborn' for insightful visualizations.
- **Key Insights**: Highlights top-performing categories and average sales.
- **Cleaned Dataset**: Saves the processed data as a new CSV file.
